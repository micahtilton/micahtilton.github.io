## Initial Expectations
ICS414 was my second semester taking a Software Engineering class. My experience with this class was very different from my first semester. In my first semester, I learned the necessary skills to create a production-ready application. I felt overwhelmed with the amount of content that we needed to cover in such a short time. We learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and MongoDB. Each of these topics could be a class on its own. I expected ICS414 to continue teaching different tools. However, we refined our previous knowledge by creating an app for a client. This was a very refreshing class since I was able to showcase my abilities and leave the class with another project to add to my resume.

## Team and Organization
The class was organized with meetings every week to check up on our progress. We learned how to use GitHub tools to create and track application progress. We called these checkpoints milestones, and it represented goals that we should achieve by the end of the week. These organization techniques helped our team of 6 busy college students to work together effectively.

## Struggles
Although this class refined skills that we have previously learned, that does not mean that we did not learn anything. One struggle was that we did not have any people dedicated to specific tasks. Everyone worked on a little bit of everything. This caused some parts of our UI to not be consistent which made it difficult for others to integrate the back-end to the front-end. Consistency in code style was a challenge, but we used tools such as ESLint to ensure that our code conforms to a standard. Our group of 6 people did not have any aligned free time besides class time which made it difficult for us to work together outside of class. We solved this problem by creating a Discord server where we would communicate our plans for the week. This class helped me to understand the importance of consistency within code style, project organization and setting weekly goals.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I had a great experience taking ICS414. I learned skills in a hands-on fashion that helped me to solidify the skills I had previously learned. I hope to take these skills even further to possibly go from working with a team of 6 to a team of thousands of people working together to achieve a common goal. Even though I learned skills that helped organize team projects, these skills are also very useful for solo projects. In the future, I will try to incorporate these skills into projects of my own. I will try to apply the things I have learned in class into my work. ICS414 has been a great experience and I would recommend anyone studying Computer Science to take a higher-level Software Engineering class as it will level up your programming and project management.
