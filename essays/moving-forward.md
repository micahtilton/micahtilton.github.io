## Interests:
I have been programming for about four years now and I used languages such as Swift, C, C++, C#, Python and JavaScript. However, I have always struggled with creating large scale applications. I have made a few mobile games using SwiftUI and Unity Game Engine. But as time went on, my code quality started to decrease. I think that this was due to the fact that I needed more practice implementing design patterns and knowing when to use a specific one. 

## Moving Forward:
In the future, I would like to create code that is clean, maintainable, and understandable. This will be hard work as I will need to practice using tools such as GitHub for version control and collaboration, reading books on design patterns, and getting my feet wet in making digital art for game development. All of these tasks will require hard work and I am ready to put in the effort.

I hope that in the near future I will be able to work on projects in a larger group. I believe that working effectively with others is an important skill in software development. When I participated in a Global Game Jam while in the Game Dev club, I worked in a group of about 5-7 people. Most of us were new to using GitHub so there were a lot of merge conflicts that set us back a few days. However, after a day of lost progress and code that would not compile, we completed our first game jam together and that is an experience that I will never forget. I hope to have more of these experiences in the future as it helped me to grow as a developer.
