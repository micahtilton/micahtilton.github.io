## Inspiration: 
After graduating high school, I decided to take a year off from college. I wanted to take my time to figure out my interests before committing four years of time and money. During that year, I created programming content, which helped me discover the areas of Computer Science that I truly enjoy. After gaining clarity on my passions, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

## Veritasium Contest:
This project was my entry into the Veritasium Contest hosted by Derek Muller. My video briefly explains what P vs NP is with engaging graphical animations.

## Other Content:
I also created puzzle-solving videos for people to get a sense of what is possible with basic understanding of programming principles.
