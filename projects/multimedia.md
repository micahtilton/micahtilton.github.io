## Inspiration: 
After highschool I took a break from college for a year. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet and I did not want to commit four years of my time and money unless I was sure of what I wanted in my future. Creating programming content helped me to identify what fields of Computer Science that I enjoy the most. After one year, I decided to continue my education in Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa. 

## Veritasium Contest:
This project was my entry into the Veritasium Contest hosted by Derek Muller. My video briefly explains what P vs NP is with engaging graphical animations.

## Other Content:
I also created puzzle-solving videos for people to get a sense of what is possible with basic understanding of programming principles.
